### Objectives and user experience
The project explores the intricate relationship between identity and numerical values, drawing inspiration from systems like passport numbers and settlement status share codes, and paralleling these with computer programming concepts. The goal is to immerse the viewer within a desktop documentary that navigates through government websites, which progressively become more glitchy and unsettling. This disorientation culminates in a simulated 'shutdown' of the interface, ultimately breaking down into a screen filled with cryptic code and messages directly addressing the viewer's identity. By integrating moments like the screen turning black, creating a 'black mirror' effect, the project deepens the immersive experience. The unsettling atmosphere is amplified by excessive pop-ups and the final collapse of the interface, which hints at the viewer's identity being absorbed into a vast database. The overarching aim is to produce a series of short clips that delve into how individuals, within the broader digital and bureaucratic landscapes, are often reduced to mere numbers in a system. This approach not only explores the theme of identity but also evokes a sense of unease by simulating the viewer's loss of control as their data is seemingly collected and cataloged.
